# Instructions

Hey professor, when you compile my program, make sure to do XYZ as you mentioned
we could do in class, because the other method doesnâ€™t seem to work.

Also, you are super awesome and I will tell everyone great tales of this semester.

# My Thoughts
The first assignment was good. It taught me how to solve my problems and to understand the work flow for our future assignents ahead. Other than that I hope this assignement will be a little easier for me. 

# 'I promise not to forget that all future assignments may be heavily penalized for failure to commit frequently as I do my work.'
